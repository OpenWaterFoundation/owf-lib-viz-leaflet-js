# owf-lib-viz-leaflet-js
Open Water Foundation JavaScript visualization library based on Leaflet

## Getting Started

A standard development folder structure is recommended. The website development files can be set up as follows (Windows is assumed, but linux would be similar):

```
> C:
> cd \Users\user
> mkdir Leaflet-js
> cd Leaflet-js
> mkdir git-repos
> cd git-repos
> git clone https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-lib-viz-leaflet-js
```

The repository contains multiple folders that contain examples of each type of visualization.
