## What is a Choropleth Map

Choropleth Maps display divided geographical areas or regions that are colored, shaded, or patterned in relation to a data variable. This provides a way to visualize values over a geographical area, which can show variation or patterns across the displayed location.

The data variable uses color progression to represent itself in each region of the map. Typically, this can be a blending from one color to another, a single hue progression, transparent to opaque, light to dark or an entire color spectrum.

One downside to the use of color is that you can't accurately read or compare values from the map. Another issue is that larger regions appear more emphasized then smaller ones, so the viewer's perception of a shaded values are affected.

A common error when producing Choropleth Maps is to encode raw data values (such as population) rather than using normalized values (calculating population per square kilometer for example) to produce a density map.
